Install Anaconda online at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individualâ€¨
Create environment for python app using condo create -n ENV_NAME python=3.8

Install all packages needed -including django-heroku and gunicorn

Run pip freeze > requirements.txt - captures the required packages to run

In settings.py, make sure you have the following:
- Include static root and project root
PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'static')
- django_heroku.settings(locals())

Touch a Procfile in your parent folder which includes the following:
- web: gunicorn AppName.wsgi --log-file -

Then push to Heroku Remote

IF THIS FAILS:
Run heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python --app APP NAME

And try again.

Once this has succeeded, run the following:
- heroku run python3 manage.py migrate

This will then update your tables.
